# Ematarkus Queue by Default

This 'Ematarkus Queue by Default' is an alternative to wondibles 'Queue by Default'. It's a derivate of his mod.

All commands and build commands are appended to queue by default. Holding shift starts a new queue. Ctrl key does so too, but might be disabled in future. as you might be able to queue fast move orders.

The build mode (fab mode) stays as soon as 'Esc' is pressed, or right click happens. After that right click, you might use left click to clear the selection and/or select other stuff.
